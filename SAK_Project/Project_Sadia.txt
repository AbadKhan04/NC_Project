Proj 01: Developing movie of a flying projectile using Matlab and Python

The projectile motion, a branch of a complex physics and an interesting phenomenon of investigation for many centuries till today. It deals with the study of substantially below the speed of light. The advancement of the problem has come from three fields: physics, mathematics, and computation for various industry, civil, and military applications. As a physical and mathematical in nature, the focus has been given on the methods for computation, simulation and analysis of the governing equations of motion. In this project, the projectile motion with various drag forces: (a) zero drag, (b) linear drag, (c) quadratic drag are computed, simulated and analysed for predicting various trajectories profiles with three set of input parameters using MATLAB source codes.

Project Requirements
1. You should be able to discuss brief theory of projectile motion with various drag forces (at most 2 pages).
2. Your solution must be able to demonstrate calculations to solve the projectile motion with various drag forces: (a) zero drag, (b) linear drag, (c) quadratic drag with Matlab.
3. It should also compare results obtained by Matlab and Python programs.
4. You should also compare exact solutions and approximate solutions from your developed programs with respect to errors.
5. You should develop a GUI as it simplifies the utilization of these methods by providing an intuitive and interactive interface, eliminating the need for extensive programming knowledge
6. You should prepare a report to mention all requirements of the project and details of solution to problems.
7. Useful plots of projectile motion with different cases be included in the project report.

Thank you for providing the MATLAB and Python code files, as well as the theoretical discussion. With these files, I can better assist you in completing the remaining tasks for your projectile motion project.

Based on the project requirements and the files you've provided, here's what we need to focus on:

1. **Report Preparation (Requirement 6):**
   - You already have a good theoretical overview (theory.md) that covers the key points. We can incorporate this into the report.
   - We need to add descriptions of the numerical methods used to solve the governing equations (e.g., Runge-Kutta, Euler's method) in the report.
   - Include details of your MATLAB (Flying_Projectile.m) and Python (Flying_Projectile.py) implementations, with code snippets or pseudocode.
   - Document the validation and comparison of results from MATLAB and Python, including the error analysis (already implemented in the code files).
   - Explain the GUI design and functionality (implemented in Python).

2. **Plots and Visualizations (Requirement 7):**
   - You have implemented the plotting of trajectories for different drag cases in both MATLAB and Python.
   - However, we need to generate additional plots for various input parameters (e.g., different initial velocities, launch angles) to showcase the projectile motion under different conditions.
   - Include these plots in the project report.

3. **Finalizing the Project:**
   - Organize the report by creating sections for the theoretical overview, numerical methods, code documentation, result analysis, GUI documentation, and plots/visualizations.
   - Ensure that all requirements are addressed appropriately in the report.
   - Compile the report in a professional format (e.g., PDF) for submission.

To assist you further, I can:

- Help you structure and format the report, including creating sections, adding content, and organizing the information.
- Provide guidance on documenting the numerical methods, code implementations, and GUI functionality.
- Generate additional plots and visualizations for different input parameters using your existing code.
- Review the report and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Please let me know if you would like me to proceed with any specific task or if you have any additional questions or concerns. I'll be happy to help you complete your projectile motion project successfully.
